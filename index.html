<h4>Tools for my papers & researches</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/UNIST-LOFT/JPatchInst">JPatchInst</a>, a Java Instrumentation tool to instrument patched program generated by SimAPR or other APR tools. It is used in our ASE paper.

        I added several features to tree-sitter. First, I added "value" for some type of nodes to represent the type of operator or name of the identifier and literal. Then, I added simple interpreter to execute simple expression at runtime. My tree-sitter is in <a href="https://github.com/UNIST-LOFT/tree-sitter">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        I modified py-tree-sitter, a Python binding for tree-sitter, to use my custom tree-sitter. My py-tree-sitter is in <a href="https://github.com/UNIST-LOFT/py-tree-sitter">here</a>.

    <li>
        <a href='https://github.com/UNIST-LOFT/SimAPR'>SimAPR</a>, a Patch Scheduling Algorithm Simulator used in Automated Program Repair from Fuzzing Perspective.
